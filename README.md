shrike lite FPGA projects are available in this repository

To write verilog code for this Shrike Lite FPGA u need
1) "Go Configure Software Hub"   https://www.renesas.com/en/software-tool/go-configure-software-hub#overview
2) for simulation of verilog code in "Go Configure Software Hub software", u need icarus verilog   https://bleyer.org/icarus/
3) use this renesas manual for configuring icarus verilog in  "Go Configure Software Hub software" https://www.macnica.co.jp/en/business/semiconductor/articles/renesas/146328/
4) shrike lite fpga full adder verilog code demo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufa__6MhEqY
5) use thonny ide software ( https://thonny.org ) for uploading bitstream file into shrike lite fpga   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT5bMX5sSow
